There are not many examples of useful Ocaml functions online. This repo contains a dump of useful Ocaml functions. To see how the functions are sorted, see **Searching for a fuction** below.




## Searching for a function

- `tuples.ml`   contains functions that take one or several tuple parameters
- `lists.ml`    contains functions that take one or several list paramters
- `strings.ml`  contains functions that take one or several string parameters

**For Example** if you are looking for a function that takes in a string but returns a list, it will be located in `strings.ml`

All the functions in the repository have comments explaining what they do. 
It may be useful to use  `Command F` to search for a specific function.
